# Making a webpage interactive with JavaScript

This Landing Page project was a static webpage made with HTML & CSS.
I used JavaScript to add some interactivity to it.

The interactive features are:
1. Building the navigation bar dynamically.
2. Smooth scrolling to different parts or sections in the page when clicking on a navigation item.
3. Highlight sections that are being viewed while scrolling.
